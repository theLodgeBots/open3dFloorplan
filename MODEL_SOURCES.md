- Formats vary widely (many OBJ/FBX, some glTF)

## Recommendations

1. **Download first (highest value):**
   - Kenney Nature Kit (330 models — boulders, bushes, rocks, flowers)
   - Kenney Graveyard Kit (metal fences)
   - Kenney City Kit Suburban (picket fences, yard items)
   - Quaternius Stylized Nature MegaKit (flowers, rocks — has native glTF!)

2. **For missing items with no CC0 source** (BBQ grill, sun lounger, pergola, gazebo, deck):
   - Consider creating simple procedural/parametric GLB models
   - Or use a tool like Blender to create basic low-poly versions (~30 min each)
   - These are relatively simple geometric shapes

3. **Format conversion needed for Quaternius:**
   - Most Quaternius packs ship FBX/OBJ — need Blender or `gltf-pipeline` to convert to GLB
   - Exception: Stylized Nature MegaKit already includes glTF

4. **License note on Poly.pizza:**
   - Most models are CC-BY 3.0, not CC0
   - If attribution is acceptable, there are many more options available
