## 📱 Companion iOS App

Scan a room with your iPhone and get an editable floor plan in seconds. The OpenPlan3D iOS app uses LiDAR (with an AR fallback for non-LiDAR devices) to build walls, doors, and windows as you walk, calculates room areas automatically, and shows the result in 2D and 3D — then hands the plan off to the web editor with one tap (see [iOS capture handoff](#-ios-capture-handoff)).

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to try openplan3d is the hosted version at **[app.openplan3d.com](https://app.openplan3d.com/)** — no install needed.

To run it locally, use Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`) and npm:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D.git
cd openPlan3D

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Development Checks

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run build
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:browser
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks for pull requests and pushes to `main`.
The regression suite covers local storage failures, autosave status, room metadata
and exports, and keyboard tools. Use `npm run test:watch` while working on a fix.
Production-browser CI covers import/edit/undo/save/reload/export, damaged-file
recovery, catalog loading, 3D and cold/warm asset transfers. It starts an isolated
Node server with analytics and cloud uploads disabled. Failure screenshots/traces
and the HTML report are retained for seven days. Drawing and touch gestures still
need separate interactive/device checks.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 📱 iOS capture handoff

The companion iOS app can share an edited plan or [Apple RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/) scan with the web editor. Local **Export Editable Plan (JSON)** requires no cloud upload.

1. The updated iOS app posts JSON to `/api/handoffs`, which validates it and reserves quota before creating `inbox/{CODE}.json` in `openplan3d.firebasestorage.app`. The code excludes I, O, 0 and 1. Unchanged plans reuse a valid link. Older distributed builds still upload directly to Storage during migration.
2. The app shows a QR code / link of the form:

   ```
   https://app.openplan3d.com/editor?import=CODE
   ```

3. When the editor opens with an `import` query param, it downloads the JSON straight from Firebase Storage (no SDK needed):

   ```
   https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/openplan3d.firebasestorage.app/o/inbox%2F{CODE}.json?alt=media
   ```

   and imports it as a new project. Prepared iPhone exports preserve their angles by default; raw captures retain their scan-cleanup defaults. On success the `import` param is replaced with the new project's `id` so a refresh won't re-import.

During migration, [`storage.rules`](storage.rules) still permits legacy public creates below 10 MiB. **This bypasses aggregate admission limits until cutover.** The new endpoint enforces 1 MiB per capture, 100 reservations / 25 MiB per UTC day, and 10 reservations per minute. See [configuration, costs and the client migration gate](docs/handoff-quotas.md). These limits are not a cap on Firebase spending.

### One-time setup (project owner)

1. **Enable Storage** for the `openplan3d` project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openplan3d/storage) if it isn't already.
2. **Deploy the rules:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

3. **Auto-delete stale captures** — set a lifecycle rule that makes objects under the `inbox/` prefix eligible for deletion at age 1 day (prefix-scoped lifecycle uses `matchesPrefix`; deletion is asynchronous). Save this as `lifecycle.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "rule": [
       {
         "action": { "type": "Delete" },
         "condition": { "age": 1, "matchesPrefix": ["inbox/"] }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Then apply it with either:

   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets update gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app --lifecycle-file=lifecycle.json
   # or
   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app
   ```

   Review the bucket's soft-delete, versioning, and retention settings as well.
   Deleted objects can remain billable during soft-delete retention; a one-day
   lifecycle does not guarantee one day of billed storage. Consider disabling
   recovery only for a bucket dedicated to reproducible temporary transfers,
   after confirming originals remain safely stored on-device. See the
   [live configuration audit and cost plan](docs/reviews/2026-09-05-firebase-cost-audit.md)
   and [Cloud Storage soft-delete guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/soft-delete).

4. **CORS** — the editor downloads captures from the browser, so the bucket must allow
   cross-origin GETs (without this the import fails with a CORS error in the console).
   Save this as `cors.json`:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "origin": [
         "https://app.openplan3d.com",
         "https://openplan3d--openplan3d.us-east4.hosted.app",
         "http://localhost:5173"
       ],
       "method": ["GET"],
       "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
       "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
     }
   ]
   ```

   Then apply it (changes take a minute or two to propagate):

   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets update gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app --cors-file=cors.json
   ```
