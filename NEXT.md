# Next work and pause handoff

Updated September 7, 2026. This is the current backlog for the web app and iPhone
companion. It supersedes the historical “next” sections in the
[original review and batch log](docs/reviews/2026-09-05-current-state-and-roadmap.md).
Priorities below are proposed order, not release dates or a claim of complete
Planner 5D parity.

## Current implementation baseline

The furniture category batch for [#63](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/issues/63)
is implemented in both repositories. Package/RoomPlan imports share category
rules, native display aliases recognize web IDs, unknown categories remain
identifiable, and imported stairs have a procedural preview. Source categories,
IDs, fractional dimensions and metadata survive actual native return packages.
See [the batch report](docs/reviews/2026-09-07-furniture-categories.md) and GitHub
PR checks for merge/release status and final browser CI results.

The browser compatibility batch for [#65](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/issues/65)
adds the full CI suite to Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, fixes canvas shortcuts
intercepting field editing, and preserves furniture dimensions while replacing
empty/invalid drafts. See [the browser report](docs/reviews/2026-09-07-cross-browser-editing.md)
and PR checks for final engine results and merge/release status.

Local validation: **544 web unit tests, 53 XCTest tests**, production build and
audit pass; type checks report zero errors and 23 existing Svelte warnings.
Desktop and phone-width browser checks cover labels, editing, persistence and
3D. Native source availability remains separate from TestFlight/App Store release.

Already delivered: storage safety and recovery; connected editing and numeric
dimensions; named-room exports and physical PDF scale; dependency remediation;
floor elevations and sloped walls; direct AI provider configuration; safe imports
and project switching; local tab conflict recovery; IndexedDB migration; full
library backup/restore; two-way local iPhone/web packages; editable item
notes/photos/costs and pooled attachment history; furniture appearance fixes;
category continuity; field keyboard editing and browser-engine CI; camera preview
and 3D resource cleanup. Earlier batches and pause hashes are recorded
in the dated review log and git history.

## 1. Next engineering batch: rendering benchmarks and device coverage

The measured resource batch for [#67](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/issues/67)
repairs blank reopened camera previews, releases renderer contexts and replaced
scene textures, and disposes/reapplies wall highlights through rebuilds. The
pre-fix browser measurements confirmed retained contexts and texture growth. See
[the resource report](docs/reviews/2026-09-07-viewer-resources.md) and PR checks for
final validation and merge/release status.

Next, establish repeatable small/medium/large-home benchmarks and agreed frame-time
and memory targets on representative desktop/phone hardware. Measure before
changing mobile quality or replacing whole-scene rebuilds. Extend desktop Safari
checks to actual iPhone/iPad touch devices; the resource batch's native desktop
Safari attempt was unavailable while the Mac was locked. Keep category contract
fixtures in both repositories synchronized when extending the catalog.

Legacy saved package projects with chair fallbacks are protected on export and
re-import. A later usability improvement can refresh those old local previews
on opening while preserving recovery data; do not guess categories for old
RoomPlan chair imports that have no retained source.

## 2. Release and Firebase cost gates

Keep [#30](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/issues/30) open until all three
remaining gates are verified:

1. **Ship and test the updated iPhone client.** Prepare TestFlight/App Store
   distribution; exercise Files/AirDrop package exchange and real LiDAR/AR
   capture on physical devices; establish older-client compatibility requirements.
2. **Migrate clients, then cut over Storage rules.** Legacy public direct creates
   are still enabled. The staged admission endpoint has quotas, but this bypass
   means there is **no aggregate bucket cap yet**. After migration, deploy the
   reviewed candidate and verify anonymous creates/private ledger access are
   denied while admitted writes, valid links and local file exchange work.
   Candidate rule tests passed; active rules have not been cut over. Follow
   [the migration procedure](docs/handoff-quotas.md), including updating committed
   `storage.rules` so later deployments cannot reopen the bypass.
3. **Agree a monthly budget with a billing administrator.** Include Storage,
   both App Hosting backends and supporting services. Configure/verify alerts;
   the audit account lacks billing-account access and the Budget API was disabled
   at the audit. Alerts notify; they do not enforce a spending cap. Recheck current
   telemetry and retained bytes before changing quotas or retention.

Preserve the low-cost design: ordinary editing, history, backups, photos and full
project-package exchange stay local. Reuse bundled, cacheable catalog assets and
unchanged temporary shares; keep downloads lazy. The endpoint currently bounds
captures to 1 MiB, 100 reservations or 25 MiB per UTC day, and 10 reservations per
minute. Failed writes retain reservations. These limits do not cap downloads or
total spending. Keep the audited one-day inbox lifecycle and seven-day soft delete
unless new measurements justify a reviewed change. Avoid adding a database,
durable cloud copies, sync or media uploads without a cost model and enforceable
quotas. See the [cost audit](docs/reviews/2026-09-05-firebase-cost-audit.md) and
[cost/browser report](docs/reviews/2026-09-05-cost-controls-and-browser-ci.md).

## 3. Remaining quality and fidelity work

These are follow-up work areas, not claims that every item is a reproduced bug.

- **Browser and device coverage:** keep all three CI engines passing; broaden
  the bounded desktop Safari pass and test actual iPhone/iPad touch, gestures,
  downloads/share sheets and storage/quota recovery. Exercise native denied camera access,
  interruption/backgrounding, long scans, multi-floor work and attachment-heavy
  saves. Run a first-room usability session with unfamiliar desktop/iPhone users.
- **3D performance:** keep the measured preview-context and scene-allocation
  regressions passing. The confirmed cleanup defects are addressed in #67/#68.
  Add small/medium/large-home benchmarks, agreed desktop and phone frame-time/memory
  targets, and measured mobile quality settings. Consider updating changed objects
  instead of rebuilding whole scenes only after measuring the benefit.
- **Area/geometry agreement:** define whether area is measured at interior wall
  faces or another boundary, reconcile native raster-based areas with web polygons,
  and test room split/merge identity and schedules. Matching area totals are not
  yet an established cross-platform guarantee.
- **Building completeness:** implement slabs, stair voids and common roof forms.
  Floor elevations and variable endpoint wall heights already exist. Extend native
  editing/preview fidelity for curves, slopes, elevations, opening styles and
  annotations while retaining unsupported data through package returns.
- **Known package presentation limits:** native previews still use straight,
  uniform-height walls and simplified furniture; only one unrotated first-floor
  embedded PNG/JPEG/GIF tracing image maps to the native underlay. Other imagery
  settings remain retained. Unenclosed native room labels are preserved without
  web room fill. Room ceiling overrides travel as metadata; web wall heights
  continue to govern 3D geometry. Broaden these capabilities deliberately with
  preservation tests. Original unsupported attachment formats remain downloadable;
  web photo previews are bounded JPG/PNG. See the package contract for exact limits.
- **Catalog and rendering quality:** maintain a catalog manifest with source/license
  attribution, real dimensions, scale/origin and platform support. Curate complete
  room sets, improve native furniture visuals, and refine materials, lighting,
  cutaway/dollhouse views, framing, saved cameras and deterministic render/export
  quality. Current finishes are visual controls, not physical material simulation.
- **Localization and usability:** revive English/Portuguese localization from
  closed community [PR #15](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/pull/15) as a
  focused string-system change. Recheck first-use navigation, dense toolbars,
  readable labels, accessibility and touch property editing. Earlier interaction
  fixes are already merged; reproduce any remaining problem before changing them.

## 4. Longer-term Planner 5D parity

- Controlled local custom GLB/model import and bounded texture assets, then other
  formats as justified; retain provenance, size limits and safe failure behavior.
- Editable floor-plan recognition, scan repair and layout assistance with results
  users can review. AI images remain separate from authoritative measured geometry.
  Direct AI providers already exist; do not revive the unrestricted hosted proxy
  from the original community proposal.
- Read-only sharing, optional account-backed sync, comments/permissions and
  concurrent editing with explicit offline/conflict/recovery behavior. These are
  not implemented cloud features. Start only after the cost gates above; consider
  self-hosting/user-supplied storage for durable large libraries.
- Consistent room schedules, quantity budgets, shopping lists and moodboards.
  Existing item notes/photos and entered costs provide the starting data.

## 5. Repository and release maintenance

- Replace stale `FEATURES.md` and comparison checklists with a tested capability
  matrix. Refresh README counts/import features and add contributor guidance,
  fixture-oriented issue/PR templates and a release checklist. Historical review
  findings and original package metadata are not authoritative current status.
- Reduce the 23 existing Svelte warnings with focused accessibility/component
  changes. The CI artifact actions now use pinned Node 24 releases. Continue dependency
  auditing rather than treating the original resolved advisories as still open.
- Decide whether to publish/license the currently private iOS repository, add a
  root contributor README, and clarify the two native targets/release branding.
  Review the current iOS 26.2 minimum before distribution; lowering it requires
  an API-availability audit and device testing. These are product/release decisions.

## Resume checklist

1. Fetch both repositories and confirm clean `main` against `origin/main`; reread
   open GitHub issues and #30 for release updates. Start a focused `codex/…` branch
   from current main after checking the browser batch merge status.
2. Start with measured resource checks. Preserve unknown fields,
   explicit clears, independent import copies, fractional transforms and pooled
   local attachments. Do not rely on temporary QA directories as source artifacts.
3. Web baseline: Node 24/npm; run `NODE_ENV=production npm run check`,
   `NODE_ENV=production npm test` and `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`.
   Production browser workflows run in GitHub CI with cloud uploads/analytics
   disabled. Use the approved browser-control tools for local interactive QA.
4. Native baseline: `openPlan3d.xcodeproj`, scheme `FloorPlan`, Debug simulator
   tests with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`. Select an available simulator; rerun
   actual native return-package fixtures when the contract changes. Complete
   physical-device release checks separately.
5. Keep documentation/issues aligned with results, merge only after relevant
   checks, verify deployment for application changes and remove merged branches.
   Browser QA projects are local browser data, not source-controlled project files.
